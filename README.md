# Digimon Story Evolution Vue (Frontend)

## Introduction

This repository contains the frontend for the Digimon Evolution Web App. It uses Vue.js to provide a dynamic and interactive user interface that communicates with the backend API. This project serves as a learning exercise to explore new technologies and frameworks.

## Motivation

My love for Digimon Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Hacker's Memory games inspired me to create this project. While playing these games, I found a PDF that detailed the digivolution chart, complete with hyperlinks to each Digimon's image. This PDF was incredibly helpful, and I wanted to recreate that experience on the web while learning new technologies.

## Features

- **Vue.js**: Implements the frontend user interface.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an interactive experience with clickable Digimon images.
- **Pagination and Filtering**: Allows users to filter and paginate Digimon data.

## Technologies Used
